NaveGo: an open-source MATLAB toolbox for simulating integrated navigation systems.

## Contributions

We are looking for contributors for NaveGo! Until now, NaveGo is a one-man project. I am hoping that the navigation community to compromise and contribute with this open-source tool.

If you are interested, please contact Dr. Rodrigo Gonzalez at rodralez [at] frm [dot] utn [dot] edu [dot] ar.

## Documentation

The underlying mathematical model of NaveGo is based on two articles that are recommended for reading:
