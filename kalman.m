% Step 1, update Kalman gain
IS = (R + H * P * H');
K = (P * H') / (IS) ;

% Step 2, update vector state
xu = x + K * (y - H*x);
% xu = K*y;                 % This expression can be used when x = 0.

% Step 3, update covariance matrix
Pu = (I - K*H) * P ;

% Discretization of continous-time system
% A =  expm(F*dt);
A = I + (F*dt);

% Step 4, predict xp and Pp
xp = A * xu;
Pp = (A * Pu * A') + Qd;
Pp =  0.5 .* (Pp + Pp');
