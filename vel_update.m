S = skewm(velold);

coriolis = S * (omega_en_N + 2 * omega_ie_N);

% KNOWN ISSUES: acceleration in Z axis is considered negative downward because 
% Navego works (surprisingly) better this way. This Z axis orientation does 
% not correspond with NED coordinates. So, g is positive in the following equation.

fn_cor = fn - coriolis - (-g);

vel_upd = velold + fn_cor * dt;

end
